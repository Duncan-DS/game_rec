Computer Science Project:
    This is a basic recommendation program for Games

How it works:
    Through inputs in the Terminal/Command-line (Inputs will vary, a full name of a genre or the first couple of letters of the genre) will load a suggested category based on the input that will be shown for you to explore. Once a suggessted category is suggested, a variety of recommendations will be provided (NB* Reccomendations are subject to change due to updates and peroid in which the script is used). A total of five recomendations will be shown, along with their price, release date, PG rating and Publisher.

    The data gatherd is from IGN and from Steam and there are some games that are not on steam, that data came from a Google search

Flask REST API:
    Flask is a small and lightweight python web framework. REST(Representational State Transfer) is a API(Application Programming Interface) that conforms the design principles of the REST architectural style, a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.
    In short this Flask REST API will be used to acces the database file, allowing for more features to be added on into the future

Future features:
    Creating a Flask REST API Server
