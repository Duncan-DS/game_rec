Computer Science Project:
    This is a basic recommendation program for Games

How it works:
    Through inputs in the Terminal/Command-line (Inputs will vary, a full name of a genre or the first couple of letters of the genre) will load a suggested category based on the input that will be shown for you to explore. Once a suggessted category is suggested, a variety of recommendations will be provided (NB* Reccomendations are subject to change due to updates and peroid in which the script is used). A total of five recomendations will be shown, along with their price, release date, PG rating and Publisher.

    The data gatherd is from IGN and from Steam and there are some games that are not on steam, the data for those games came from Google

Future features:
